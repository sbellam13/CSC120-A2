What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I've never coded in python before so I spent a lot of time on the python documentation trying to figure out how to write code. That was way harder, for me, than anything else in this project. I made a test method in the oo_relsale_shop.py file (currently commented out) that was modeled after the main.py file and that really helped me debug my code. Advice for someone taking this course, if you don't know python very well then definitely try to learn at least the basics before you start coding, not during because it will be easier.
